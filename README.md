# 🧠 Cancer Prediction Project

 Dataset used:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/breast-cancer-dataset

## Technologies used
    - Python
    - Pandas

### Objectives
    - Clean the data
    - Make and train the model to predict breast cancer
    - Achieve 85% accurracy
    - Build interactive panel with Streamlit
    - Make a skeleton of what is being built and how it's made, to gain a deeper intuition on what's going on under the hood (Coding instead of using libraries)

### Project Structure
    - data -> Dataset file/files
    - model -> ML model
    - processing -> Dataset cleaning  
    - main.py -> Where the application runs
    - scope -> Draft from ML libraries
